### Creative Exercises Path • Pseudocoding / Encoding / Looping Animations

<details>

<summary>Assignment details</summary>

#### Part 1: Set up

Make sure you have a blog, Google Doc, Notion, or some place online to document your work and reflect on your process this semester.

#### Part 2: Encode

Use the [Encode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/encode.md)
to reverse engineer these sketches:

- [Ellen's Encode Demo](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/hlAgapATC) of
  Vera Molnár's Tête-Bêche
- [Encode 1](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/VaGWbXk_c) (class example,
  complete only if you still have questions)
- [Encode 2](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/3pFmuocV-)
- [Encode 3](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/fzcM-NjHz)
- [Encode 4](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/Lfpvl2Rsp)
- [Encode 5](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/r_6gG2Nc8)

**Note on AI:** During the Encode process, feel free to use AI and the resources
below to clarify unfamiliar concepts or syntax (see Step 3). For your Re/Code
sketch in Part 3 below, try working without AI. The goal there is to practice
your own problem-solving process.

#### Part 3: Re/Code

- Option 1: Create a loading icon (aka preloader or throbber) animation with
  code. Find and recode an existing one (different from the ones above) or
  design your own.
  Where do you often see these types of icons? Think of all the loading and
  waiting animations you encounter in your digital interactions, e.g. streaming
  video, connecting to devices, syncing accounts, payment transactions, etc. Are
  the icons related to waiting (or wasting) time? What does a loading icon
  communicate or hide? What aspect of experiencing time on a machine do you want
  to explore or express? (Source: [Aesthetic
  Programming](https://aesthetic-programming.net/))
- Option 2: Recode one of Rafaël Rozendaal's [artworks on the
  internet](https://www.newrafael.com/internet) or design a similar one.
- Make a plan with pseudocode. Write / draw an outline to guide you through the
  steps. It’s okay if you pivot from the original plan, the idea is to apply
  this approach to reverse engineer the algorithm.
- Practice reading and writing your own code and try not use an AI to help you;
  we'll get there soon enough. Remember that this course values critical
  reflection of process over product.
- Embrace experimentation and getting stuck. Related quote from Rick Rubin in
  *[The Creative Act: A Way of
  Being](https://search.library.nyu.edu/permalink/01NYU_INST/1d6v258/alma990096038880107876)*:
  > When working through ways of solving a puzzle, there are no mistakes. Each
  unsuccessful solution gets you closer to one that works. Avoid becoming
  attached to the particulars of problem. Widen your field of view. If the idea
  takes the project somewhere with a stronger energetic charge, follow the new
  direction.

#### Part 4: Document

- Document your work. Link to your sketches from Part 2 and Part 3.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the
  exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you? Where
  did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot? What
  code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?

### Self-Guided Study Path • Design a Learning Plan

<details>

<summary>Assignment details</summary>

#### Description
If you already have a project idea that requires learning a specific tool—like
building a portfolio site with HTML/CSS, or working in Python—you can spend
weeks 1-7 focused on learning that tool instead of the weekly creative
exercises. This path makes sense if you have a clear project goal, you're
comfortable working somewhat independently, and you want to front-load the
learning so you can focus on creating in the second half of the course. You'll still join class discussions and learn shared skills like version control and debugging strategies alongside everyone else.

#### Part 1: Set up

Make sure you have a blog, Google Doc, Notion, or some place online to document
your work and reflect on your process this semester.

#### Part 2: Draft a Learning Plan

Start researching and outlining a plan for what you want to learn. You don't
need to have everything figured out yet, we can refine this together. For now, start thinking through:

- **Project idea** • What do you want to build in the second half of the semester? A
  brief description is fine.
- **Tools to learn** • What language, framework, or tool do you need to learn to
   build it?
- **Resources** • What tutorials, courses, or documentation will you use? Find and
   link to at least 2-3 starting points. Video tutorials, written guides, and
   official documentation are all good options. If you're not sure where to start, then I'm happy to help you identify resources.
- **Weekly milestones** • How might you break this learning into roughly 6 weeks?
   This can be rough, and we'll adjust as you go.

#### Part 3: Document

- Share your draft learning plan: project idea, tools, resources, and rough
  milestones.
- What questions do you have? What feels uncertain?
