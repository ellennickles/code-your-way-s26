## Assignment

- Due next Monday night, Feb 16.
- No class on Monday (it's Presidents’ Day)! We will meet on Tuesday, Feb 17.


### Everyone • Version Control Part 1: Command Line Foundation

#### Command Line Scavenger Hunt Assignment

- In class we practiced navigating directories with the castle scavenger hunt. Now it's your turn to create one! Keep building your muscle memory with the
command line and design a command line scavenger hunt for your classmates.
Choose a creative theme—like a spaceship, castle, haunted house, or any
setting you like. Your hunt will help others practice navigating directories
and files while uncovering treasures and maybe a few surprises!
- Minimum requirements
  - Create **4 to 6 rooms** (directories/folders) for your scavenger hunt
  - Hide at least **2 treasures** (text files with clues, story pieces, or
    codes) and **1 danger** (a spooky twist, red herring, or warning)
  - Maybe add extra challenges, like secret rooms (nested folders) or decoy
    files or folders with misleading names to throw off your classmates and keep
    them on their toes.
- We’ll play each other’s scavenger hunts in class next week.
- Title the main directory with your first name (e.g. ellen-hunt) and it to our
  Google Drive folder here: [Week 3 • Command line scavenger
  hunts](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1JFBCODxk6f6nRIigIJfym8kzRVBO4VZP)

#### Part 1: Practice

Assemble and modify:

1. [Review loops](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/xTwj41nB9)
  (directions in sketch)

Use the [Encode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/encode.md)
and analyze the visual output to predict the input code:

2. [Encode 1](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/iu3hqCt1e)
3. [Encode 2](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/sTAx_W5n_)

Use the [Decode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/decode.md)
and analyze the input code and predict the visual output:

4. [Decode

#### Part 2: Re/Code

- Last week’s exercises used loops to repeat code. This week the idea is to
  practice using a loop’s local variable to increase values in the repeating
  code and increment visual characteristics to create a pattern(s). (You
  actually did this with the Decode 1 example last week, too.) This week's
  historical references do the same and also introduce random variation,
  sometimes to affect every element and other times to “interrupt” the repeating
  elements. Again, we’re working along the spectrum of structure and randomness.
- Building on the skills from Part 1, recode one of the examples from this
  week’s featured artists. Or draw inspiration form some contemporary artists
  linked below. Or use an element previously created for this course (or another
  one) to generate a pattern and integrate random variation(s) in some way. If
  you worked in the grid with random features for the open-ended homework last
  week, then you're welcome to push that farther if you like. Everyone is
  welcome to work from inspiration you find anywhere! Be sure to consider all
  the possible visual characteristics to modify. Animation and interaction are
  encouraged for even more variation.
- **Important:** For this part, **do not** use GitHub Copilot. Focus on applying what you've learned independently to deepen your coding skills.
- Possible inspiration:

#### Part 3: Document

- Document your work. Keep working in VS Code, and paste any final code to the
  p5 web editor so you can link to your sketches in your documentation. I know
  this is redundant, but it's still the easiest way to share. Link
  to your sketches from Parts 1-3.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the exercises
  **with and without AI**:
  - What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you?
  - Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  - Were there moments where you were tempted to use Copilot but didn’t?
  - What did you learn from coding independently in Part 2?
  - What was your process for extending your code with GitHub Copilot?
  - Reflect on your discoveries and challenges, noting where AI was helpful or
    limiting.
  - How did its contributions differ from your independent version?
  - Were there any unexpected outcomes?

### Self-Guided Study Path • Independent Learning

<details>

<summary>Assignment details</summary>

#### Part 1: Continue Learning

Keep working through your resources and building on last week's progress. This week, aim to:

- Complete the next section or module of your chosen tutorial, course, or
  resource.
- Apply what you're learning through a small exercise, experiment, or
  mini-project.
- If you're finding that your resources aren't quite right—too basic, too
  advanced, or not what you expected—that's useful information! Make a note of
  it and reach out to me so we can find alternatives together.

#### Part 2: Document

Continue documenting your weekly progress and reflections:

- What did you work on this week? (topics, exercises, mini-projects, etc.)
- What clicked? (concepts or techniques that made sense or felt useful)
- What was challenging? (any points of confusion, how you approached them, and
  whether you found a solution or decided to revisit them later)
- What's next? (next steps and any lingering questions to explore)
- If you tried Copilot: How did it go? Was it helpful, limiting, or somewhere in
  between?
