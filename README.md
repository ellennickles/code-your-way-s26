### Course Description

This course provides students an opportunity to sharpen their coding skills in several ways: by reviewing fundamental programming concepts, acquiring techniques to systematically develop code-driven projects, and then implementing those to develop an independent project with the structure and support of a classroom learning community.

The first part of the semester consists of weekly exercises to practice
strategies for learning new algorithms, writing pseudocode, debugging, refactoring, version control, generative AI, and more. Screen-based
code examples for the activities and assignments draw inspiration from the
history of creative coding. The second part of the semester shifts to a project
development studio format for students to apply these strategies to a
self-directed project. This could be an existing idea or one devised during the
course.

**New this year:** Students who already have a project idea that requires
learning a specific tool or tools have the option to spend the first half of the
semester focused on learning that tool instead of the weekly creative exercises.
This self-guided study path is designed for students who want to front-load
their learning so they can focus on creating in the second half. Students on
this path still participate in class discussions and practice shared skills alongside everyone else.

Ultimately this course aims to empower students to reflect on their process and teach themselves how to program with greater efficiency and independence. It is a direct follow-up to Introduction to Computational Media (ICM) or for anyone interested in advancing their coding practice.

Examples and exercises will be provided in JavaScript using the p5.js library.
However, students are welcome to consult the instructor about working with
another programming library, framework, or language with which they have
interest or prior experience. Prerequisite: ICM or equivalent experience.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, we will be able to:

- identify gaps in our understanding about coding concepts for further review
  and practice;
- explain techniques to debug and refactor our programs;
- apply these techniques to troubleshoot and optimize existing or new code;
- track and store revisions to our programs using a dedicated version control
  system;
- compare approaches for designing and developing code-based projects;
- outline a plan to independently create such a project;
- integrate any relevant technical concepts and strategies necessary to complete
  it.

### Format

This is a 14-week course that meets once a week in person. Class time is divided
into individual and group exercises, studio time, opportunities for project
development, sharing assignments, and exchanging feedback. Weekly skill
exercises target approaches and techniques for developing projects with code.
Studio is multipurpose time to work on assignments (individually or in small
groups), to share skills and resources, to review topics, and to conference with
the instructor.

### Community Guidelines

In keeping with the [ITP/IMA Code of
Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index), this course is
committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for
everyone in our community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be
tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content.

### Communication and Support

#### Inside of class

During class, we will use [our Miro board](https://tinyurl.com/cyw26-miro),
a free and online whiteboard with chat functionality to collaborate and share resources.

#### Outside of class

- You must check your NYU email for important updates about class.
- You are welcome to attend Student Hours in person or on Zoom (sign up above).
- Use our course website here on GitHub to check the schedule (updated as needed
  based on our pace and interests), assignments, and links to course materials including resources in Google Drive.

#### Support

Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and
require different kinds of accommodations. If there are aspects of this course
that prevent you from learning or exclude you in any way, I invite you to
communicate this with me. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your
needs and the requirements of the course.

In addition, if you ever feel that you are struggling with the material or
falling behind for other reasons, please reach out to me, and we'll work
together to ensure that you have proper support.

When in doubt, it’s ALWAYS better to contact me sooner rather than later about
attendance, assignments, or anything else on your mind.

### Assessment and Evaluation

Course assessments take the form of weekly assignments, a final project, and
participation and attendance. Check the schedule above for links to the
assignments.

#### Overview of Assignments

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous
class, and you should be prepared to share and talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in our class will create and maintain a blog (or Notion, Google Doc, etc.) for their assignments.

All assignments are required, and unless otherwise stated, are due the night
before our class meets, one (1) week after they are assigned unless stated
otherwise. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the assignment deadlines,
please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together.

The course culminates with a final independent project. You are expected to push
your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the
course that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world.

#### Grading

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete
(half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete, an assignment should
meet the criteria specified in the assignment description including
documentation.  If significant portions are simply not attempted it may be
marked partially complete.  If an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria
specified it will be marked incomplete.

#### Extensions

An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an extension
before the due date, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do not
request an extension, the grading rules above apply. Please clarify with me, and
we'll set a deadline together. The recommended timeline is one (1) to five (5) days.

Note: There may be instances where having an extension may result in not being
able to participate fully in activities such as feedback sessions or
workshopping ideas/projects, which likely cannot be made up if it could disrupt
the overall course schedule. Extensions are distributed at the discretion of the
instructor.

#### Final Course Evaluation

Final course evaluation will be based on participation and attendance, and the completion of all assignments, including the final independent project, according to this breakdown:

- 30% Participation and attendance
- 50% Weekly assignments
- 20% Independent project

This class uses a [Pass/Fail](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/pass-fail/) grading system. A Pass is equivalent to an A or a B grade, and anything less is considered a Fail.

### Policies

#### AI Guidelines

The emergence of generative AI tools, such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's
Claude, is exciting for creative coders. We can use these tools to brainstorm
ideas, to write code snippets or entire solutions for our projects, as well as
to debug our programs and explain technical concepts. These tools are
increasingly sophisticated, and we should learn how to effectively use them.
However, we must use such tools responsibly not just because of their
limitations (randomness, bias, incorrect information, privacy, copyrighted
material) but also, if you are still new to creating with code, overreliance on
AI and without critical reflection can potentially hinder independent thinking,
creativity, and dull understanding. Our goal is to learn how to use
these tools enhance these, not hinder. To this end we will intentionally
experiment with generative AI tools for some assignments and activities, but not
all, to meet our course learning objectives. When use of the tool is allowed, it
will be explicitly noted in the directions. You are responsible for all parts of
an assignment; if an AI tool violates intellectual property laws or contain
misinformation or unethical content, it is your responsibility to find and fix
the errors before submitting. When you use generative AI tools for any part of
your assignment (from idea generation to code generation to program debugging),
document how and why you used the tool in accordance with our [Citation
Guidelines](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/README.md#citation-guidelines).

Frequently Asked Questions](https://t.e2ma.net/click/w9j5ci/ozu8bgf/4fuzym) (PDF) and related university resources: [Instructor Generative
AI Guides](https://www.nyu.edu/faculty/teaching-and-learning-resources/teaching-with-generative-tools.html#instructor)
and [Student Learning with Generative
AI](https://www.nyu.edu/faculty/teaching-and-learning-resources/Student-Learning-with-Generative-AI.html)*

#### Citation Guidelines

In accordance with the [Statement of Academic Integrity](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/README.md#academic-integrity), you are expected to cite your sources and note how you used them. For code references, a link to the online source along with a brief description will suffice. If you use any generative AI tools, e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc., please include the model name and version with description of why and how you used the tool.

#### Participation

This class is highly participatory, and there are many ways to demonstrate your
engagement with the course material and with your peers:

- show up on time with an open mind;
- contribute to class discussion;
- ask and answer questions, especially to and from your peers;
- share your assignments and progress with the class;
- engage in group exercises with curiosity and enthusiasm;
- help your peers by sharing your knowledge and experience;
- attend Student Hours for review and/or enrichment.

#### Absences

Attendance is mandatory. If you think you will be absent, please contact me
before class unless circumstances make this truly impossible.

There are no excused absences or unexcused absences. There are only absences.

Once you are enrolled in the course, any more than two (2) absences will affect your grade.

#### Lateness

You are expected to arrive to class on time and be ready to start at 9:30am ET.
Two (2) late arrivals (more than 10 minutes after start time) will count as one (1) absence.

### Statements

#### Land Acknowledgement

We are gathered on the unceded land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples and
acknowledge the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and
present, as well as future generations.

*Excerpt from the [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct Community
Statement](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index)*

#### Statement Of Principle

Teachers and students work together to create a supportive learning environment. The educational experience in the classroom is one that is enhanced by integrating varying perspectives and learning modes brought by students.

#### Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.
