#### Part 1: Practice

Some of these are tricky. Do the best you can to get a sense of the logical and
visual pattern(s). Your choice:
[Encode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/encode.md)
(output to input) or
[Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/decode.md)
(input to output)

#### Part 2: Re/Code

- Extending our work with loops and patterns (last week of grids?!),
  progression is the theme this week: how can you represent continuous change(s)
  within the composition color, position, size, speed, etc. and/or over time? Is
  the quality of change gradual or uneven?
- For example, can you make an interactive sketch that maps order to chaos based
  on the mouse position, e.g. “order” on the left and “chaos” on the right
  (prompt from _Code as a Creative Medium_)?
- Can you extend an example or self-designed sketch from previous
  weeks with this week’s theme?
- If you worked with gradients in the past, what are other ways to demonstrate a
  shift? (Remember that Rafaël Rozendaal, featured in Week 1, often works with
  [gradients](https://www.newrafael.com/internet/).)

#### Part 3: Document

- Document your work. Keep working in VS Code, and paste any final code to the
  p5 web editor so you can link to your sketches in your documentation. I know,
  I know...but it's still the easiest way to share. Link to your sketches from Parts 1-2.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the
  exercises:
  - What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you?
  - Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  - Did any errors or bugs lead you to a deeper understanding of how something
    works?

### Self-Guided Study Path • Independent Learning

<details>

<summary>Assignment details</summary>

#### Part 1: Keep Going - ADD A PEP TALK, Showing up each week is the actual work, Your doing it

Keep working through your resources and building on last week's progress. This week, aim to:

- Complete the next section or module of your chosen tutorial, course, or
  resource.
- Apply what you're learning through a small exercise, experiment, or
  mini-project.
- If you're finding that your resources aren't quite right—too basic, too
  advanced, or not what you expected—that's useful information! Make a note of
  it and reach out to me so we can find alternatives together.

#### Part 2: Document

Continue documenting your weekly progress and reflections:

- What did you work on this week? (topics, exercises, mini-projects, etc.)
- What clicked? (concepts or techniques that made sense or felt useful)
- What was challenging? (any points of confusion, how you approached them, and
  whether you found a solution or decided to revisit them later)
- What's next? (next steps and any lingering questions to explore)
