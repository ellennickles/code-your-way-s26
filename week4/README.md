#### Part 2a: Re/Code

- Extending our work with loops and patterns, progression is the theme this
  week: how can you represent continuous change(s) within the composition color,
  position, size, speed, etc. and/or over time? Is the quality of change gradual or uneven?
  - For example, can you make an interactive sketch that maps order to chaos
    based on the mouse position, e.g. “order” on the left and “chaos” on the
    right (prompt from _Code as a Creative Medium_)?
  - Can you extend an example or self-designed sketch from previous weeks with
    this week’s theme?
  - If you worked with gradients in the past, what are other ways to demonstrate
    a shift? (Remember that Rafaël Rozendaal, featured in Week 1, often works
    with [gradients](https://www.newrafael.com/internet/).)

#### Part 2b: Git Practice

Develop your Re/Code sketch as a local p5 project on your computer in VS Code.
This week you'll initialize your first Git repository and practice the core
commit workflow.

- Create a new folder for this sketch and open it in VS Code.
- Using the command line, navigate into the project folder and initialize it as
  a Git repository with `git init`.
- As you develop your sketch, **save your changes in VS Code first**, then
  commit them to Git:
  1. Stage your modified files: `git add <filename>` (or `git add .` for all
     changes)
  2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "your message here"`
- Aim for **at least 3 commits** that reflect meaningful steps in your
  process and not just one big commit at the end.
- Use our guides as a reference:
  - [Git
    Intro](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/version-control-guides/git.md)
  - [Tips and
    Tricks](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/version-control-guides/tips-and-tricks.md)
  - [All Version Control
    Guides](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/tree/main/version-control-guides)

> **Note:** Saving in VS Code and saving to Git are two separate steps. Think
> of VS Code saves as drafts and Git commits as intentional checkpoints you're
> choosing to record.

#### Part 3: Document

- Document your work. Keep working in VS Code, and paste any final code to the
  p5 web editor so you can link to your sketches in your documentation. I know,
  I know...but it's still the easiest way to share. Link to your sketches from Parts 1-2.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the
  exercises and **also with your new Git workflow**. And also:
  - What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you?
  - Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  - Did any errors or bugs lead you to a deeper understanding of how something
    works?
  - How did it feel to commit your work in stages? Did the commit messages help
    you think about your process differently?

### Self-Guided Study Path • Independent Learning

<details>

<summary>Assignment details</summary>

#### Part 1: Keep Going

Showing up each week and doing the work *is* the work. Learning anything new
independently can genuinely be hard, and the fact that you're here, building a
practice week by week, matters more than any single breakthrough. Progress isn't
always visible right away, but it accumulates. Trust the process.

Keep working through your resources and building on last week's progress. This week, aim to:

- Complete the next section or module of your chosen tutorial, course, or
  resource.
- Apply what you're learning through a small exercise, experiment, or
  mini-project.
- If you're finding that your resources aren't quite right—too basic, too
  advanced, or not what you expected—that's useful information! Make a note of
  it and reach out to me so we can find alternatives together.

#### Part 2: Git Practice (Optional but Encouraged)

This week in class we introduced Git for version control. Whether or not it's
relevant to your current learning plan right now depends on where you are.

**If you're already iterating on code week to week** (writing, testing, and
revising files on your own computer), then this is a good time to start practicing Git
alongside the class. Use these guides to get started:

- [Git Intro](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/version-control-guides/git.md)
- [Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/blob/main/version-control-guides/tips-and-tricks.md)
- [All Version Control Guides](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s26/tree/main/version-control-guides)

Try initializing a Git repository for your current project and making a few
commits as you work this week. Even if it feels awkward at first, the muscle
memory builds quickly.

**If you're not yet at a stage where you're managing local files**—for example,
if you're primarily working through browser-based tutorials or building
foundational knowledge—no worries. These resources will be here when you're
ready. 

#### Part 3: Document

Continue documenting your weekly progress and reflections:

- What did you work on this week? (topics, exercises, mini-projects, etc.)
- What clicked? (concepts or techniques that made sense or felt useful)
- What was challenging? (any points of confusion, how you approached them, and
  whether you found a solution or decided to revisit them later)
- What's next? (next steps and any lingering questions to explore)
- If you tried Git this week: how did it go? What was confusing or surprising?
