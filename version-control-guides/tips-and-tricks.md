## Command Line / Terminal / Shell

### Oh My Zsh!

Zsh, or the Z shell, is a shell application that interprets commands to interact
with your computer's operating system using your command line interface /
terminal. **Zsh is the default shell on macOS** (for new accounts since macOS Catalina in 2019).

Oh My Zsh is a Zsh framework that provides additional customization and
functionality, including a Git plugin, which among _many_ other features
automatically displays when you are in a Git repository and the current branch.

**Note:** This is for Mac users. Windows users using PowerShell don't need Oh My
Zsh because PowerShell has its own customization options.
